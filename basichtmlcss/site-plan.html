      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to our concise website, which is intended to provide clear and educational content on the fundamentals of web structure. 
        To guarantee clarity and applicability for people looking for basic information about basic web development, we have condensed the content into three key areas in this version.

      <h3>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</h3>
      <p>
        
        Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, is the primary language used in web development. 
        It gives web pages their structure and content, letting you make lists, headings, paragraphs, links, and more. 
        Here is a quick summary of HTML:
        
        Introduction to HTML: The foundation of every web page is HTML. 
        It organizes content using a system of tags and elements. 
        You can efficiently build and organize the content, photos, and links on your website by knowing these fundamentals.
        
        HTML Elements: Discover the basic elements of HTML, such as lists, headings, paragraphs, links, and images. 
        Every component has a distinct function and helps to the overall organization of the content on your website.
        
        HTML Forms: Explore how user interaction on websites is made possible using HTML forms. 
        Using text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and other form elements, you can collect user data. 
        Being able to design and use forms is an important web development skill.

      </ul>
      <h3>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h3>
      <p>

        Web page layout and visual design are controlled by CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets. 
        You can change fonts, colors, spacing, and other elements to make a beautiful and user-friendly website. 
        Now let's explore CSS:

        Introduction to CSS: A website's aesthetic appeal can be significantly improved with the help of CSS. 
        It offers several style properties that control the way HTML elements appear on the page. 
        You'll learn more about the importance of CSS in web design after reading this introduction.

        CSS Properties: Learn the essential CSS properties so you can effectively style your site content. 
        These variables let you modify the look of your website by changing text colors and fonts as well as the page layout.

        CSS Selectors: Selectors in CSS are used to apply style to particular HTML elements. 
        It's essential to understand multiple types of selectors, such class and ID selectors, if you want to apply styles to your online content properly.
